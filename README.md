# Computer-Graphics-Course-Project---WebGL-3D-Visualizations
This repository showcases my work from a Computer Graphics course, where I built interactive 3D visualizations using WebGL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project highlights core graphics concepts like 3D rendering, shaders, lighting, textures, and user interaction.
